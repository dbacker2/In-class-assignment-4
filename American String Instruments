## Summary 

These three instruments are all American in origin, and have each shaped American culture and   music in their own unique ways. The electric guitar, the banjo, and the ukulele are universally  recognized by all Americans if not the world. Each of these instruments has spawned entire  genres around them, and have been instrumental in forming the sound of American music. The  electric guitar changed popular music around the world since its invention. The banjo played a   key role in the formation of country music, folk music, and traditional African-American music.  The ukulele, originating in Hawaii, provided people with an accessable and affordable entry into  learning how to play stringed instruments.

# Electric Guitar

## Description 

An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its  strings into electrical signals. The vibration occurs when a guitar player strums, plucks,  fingerpicks, or taps the strings. The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses  electromagnetic induction to do so, though other technologies exist. In any case, the signal  generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is fed to a guitar  amplifier before being sent to the speaker(s), which converts it into audible sound.  

## History



Many experiments at electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made  dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Patents from the 1910s show telephone  transmitters were adapted and placed inside violins and banjos to amplify the sound. Hobbyists  in the 1920s used carbon button microphones attached to the bridge; however, these detected  vibration from the bridge on top of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal. With numerous  people experimenting with electrical instruments in the 1920s and early 1930s, there are many claimants to have been the first to invent an electric guitar. 

Electric guitars were originally designed by acoustic guitar makers and instrument  manufacturers. Some of the earliest electric guitars adapted hollow-bodied acoustic instruments  and used tungsten pickups. The first electrically amplified guitar was designed in 1931 by  George Beauchamp, the general manager of the National Guitar Corporation, with Paul Barth, who   was vice president. The maple body prototype for the one-piece cast aluminium "frying pan"  was built by Harry Watson, factory superintendent of the National Guitar Corporation. Commercial  production began in late summer of 1932 by the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (  Electro-Patent-Instrument Company), in Los Angeles, a partnership of Beauchamp, Adolph  Rickenbacker (originally Rickenbacher), and Paul Barth. In 1934, the company was renamed the  Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company. In that year Beauchamp applied for a United  States patent for an Electrical Stringed Musical Instrument and the patent was later issued in  1937.

## Construction 

Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the   configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. However, some features are present on most  guitars. The photo below shows the different parts of an electric guitar. The headstock  contains the metal machine heads, which use a worm gear for tuning. The nut —a thin  fret-like strip of metal, plastic, graphite or bone—supports the strings at the headstock end of  the instrument. The frets are thin metal strips that stop the string at the correct  pitch when the player pushes a string against the fingerboard. The truss rod is a metal  rod (usually adjustable) that counters the tension of the strings to keep the neck straight.  Position  markers provide the player with a reference to the playing position on the  fingerboard.

# Banjo

## Description

The banjo is a four-, five-, or six-stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a  frame or cavity as a resonator, called the head, which is typically circular. The membrane is  typically made of plastic, although animal skin is still occasionally used. Early forms of the  instrument were fashioned by Africans in the United States, adapted from African instruments of  similar design. The banjo is frequently associated with folk, Irish traditional, and country  music. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in African-American traditional music  and the folk culture of rural whites before entering the mainstream via the minstrel shows of  the 19th century. The banjo, along with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American old-time music. It  is also very frequently used in traditional ("trad") jazz.

## History

The modern banjo derives from instruments that had been used in the Caribbean since the 17th  century by enslaved people taken from West Africa. Written references to the banjo in North  America appear in the 18th century, and the instrument became increasingly available  commercially from around the second quarter of the 19th century.

Several claims as to the etymology of the name banjo have been made. It may derive from the  Kimbundu word mbanza. The Oxford English Dictionary states that it comes from a dialectal  pronunciation of the Portuguese "bandore" or from an early anglicisation of the Spanish word  bandurria. A Banza: a five double string courses Portuguese vihuela with two short strings.  Mbanza is a string African instrument that has been built after the Portuguese Banza. The name  may also derive from a traditional Afro-Caribbean folk dance called "banya" (which incorporates  several cultural elements found throughout the African diaspora).

## Construction

The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A  six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has gained popularity. In almost all  of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast arpeggiated plucking, though there  are many different playing styles.

The body, or pot, of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of  wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum  head. Traditionally the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various  synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal "tone ring" assembly that helps  further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.

# Ukulele

## Description

The ukulele (/juːkəˈleɪli/ yoo-kə-LAY-lee; from Hawaiian: ʻukulele [ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ] OO-koo-LEH-leh;  variant: ukelele) is a member of the lute family of instruments. It generally employs four  nylon or gut strings or four courses of strings. Some strings may be paired in courses, giving  the instrument a total of six or eight strings.

## History

The ukulele is commonly associated with music from Hawaii where the name roughly translates as  "jumping flea", perhaps because of the movement of the player's fingers. Legend attributes it to  the nickname of the Englishman Edward William Purvis, one of King Kalākaua's officers,  because of his small size, fidgety manner, and playing expertise. One of the earliest  appearances of the word ukulele in print (in the sense of a stringed instrument) is in the  Metropolitan Museum of Art's Catalogue of the Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments of  All Nations published in 1907. The catalog describes two ukuleles from Hawaii: one that is  similar in size to a modern soprano ukulele, and one that is similar to a tenor.

Developed in the 1880s, the ukulele is based on several small guitar-like instruments of  Portuguese origin, the machete, the cavaquinho, the timple, and the rajão, introduced to the  Hawaiian Islands by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira and Cape Verde. Three immigrants in  particular, Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, José do Espírito Santo, and Augusto Dias, are  generally credited as the first ukulele makers. Two weeks after they disembarked from the SS  Ravenscrag in late August 1879, the Hawaiian Gazette reported that "Madeira Islanders recently  arrived here, have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts."

## Construction

Ukuleles are generally made of wood, though variants have been composed partially or entirely of  plastic or other materials. Cheaper ukuleles are generally made from plywood or laminate  woods, in some cases with a soundboard of a tonewood such as spruce. More expensive ukuleles are  made of solid hardwoods such as mahogany. The traditionally preferred wood for ukuleles is acacia koa.
